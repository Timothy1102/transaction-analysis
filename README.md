# Transaction Analysis

Develop prototype(s) for generating meaningful insights from transaction data to inform investment decisions,
specifically focusing during the PoC phase on tokenized assets on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains.

Key outcome is the identification of "Red Flags" and the provision of notifications that can help users assess the (
changed) default risk of tokens.
